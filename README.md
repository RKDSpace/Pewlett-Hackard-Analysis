# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
# Overview of the Analysis:
Bobby’s manager has given us the assignment to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We will be preparing this report to summarize the analysis and help prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.
